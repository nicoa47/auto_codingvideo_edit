# ideas
- use Blender as video editing software (has accessible API)
- during recording, hit "debug start" and "debug end" keys
	- to be cut out
	- if forgot to start, try to find some infos just based from end key
- identify quiet periods and periods of minimal video changes
- maybe register key strokes

**TODO:**  
- check videos:

		- https://github.com/DevonCrawford/Video-Editing-Automation
		- not too sure about functionality (most of it might be done via Blender (?))
